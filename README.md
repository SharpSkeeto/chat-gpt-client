# ChatGPT React Application

This project is an innovative way to interact with the OpenAI ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 APIs. It is an alternative to the official site, allowing users to access these services even when the official site is congested or unavailable. With this application, users can easily generate natural language responses, images, and more with the power of AI. This project is an exciting way to explore the possibilities of AI and its applications.

I built this as a learning project, to learn the React/Node stack, using React (web client) and Node.js (backend prompts to OpenAI API). I am not a React or Node.js developer.  

The above introduction text was created by ChatGPT.
